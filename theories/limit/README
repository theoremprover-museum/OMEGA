The limit domain contains the domain knowledge that is necessary to plan proofs for 
limit-theorems such as LIM+, LIM*, composite, continuousDerv, limSquare. 
These proofs require to prove linear inequalities with terms that may contain
the absolute value function either directly or by introducing auxiliary variables.
See Seki Report SR-97-08 for a detailed description.
(The lim-times-wrong problem is an errornous problem to test wether a plan is
found nevertheless)

The limit domain contains the following knowledge:
methods
control-rules 
a constraint solver for linear inequalities (LINEQ)

Some other files contain functions that are necessary, e.g., for the control-rules.

Limit theorems can be planned for in OMEGA by using the following commands:
 reset-planning-state
 read-problem "xxx"
 require-complete-theory limit
 call-planner(same-m-b solve=backward SOLVE<-S-F SOLVE<-S-B 
SOLVE*-S-B limheuristic-m-b NORMAL-S-B UNWRAPHYP-S-F impe-m-b removefocus-m-f)

Unfortunately, this last command still requires to provide AT LEAST the needed methods. 
This is due to the planner's state-of-progress.
