Before you compile OMEGA, please adapt the following 
files to your local environment:

 - ilisp.emacs: change the path entry /project/omega/ilisp to your need
   (line 27)
 - make-omega-dumps: change the path to the Allegro Common Lisp (ACL)
   (lines 19 and 21)

then start the command 'make-omega-dumps'. Note that you should have
installed the MathWeb system before, because this script uses the 
MathWeb configuration files (see http://www.mathweb.org/mathweb for 
the installation of MathWeb). If everything works fine, the script 
creates the OMEGA system dumps, in a linux environment, these have
the following names:
  ./omega-3-emacs-linux.dxl
  ./omega-3-quiet-linux.dxl 

you can start a first test of the dumps with:
  lisp -I omega-3-emacs-linux.dxl
supposed you have the ACL directory in your PATH.

good luck
     your OMEGA team.
